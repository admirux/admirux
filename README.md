# Welcome to ADMIRUX GitHub Profile

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub! I’m the creator of [admirux.com](https://www.admirux.com), a Linux resource hub aimed at helping others adopt Linux and navigate the world of cybersecurity. On this GitHub, you’ll find my journey, projects, and contributions that showcase my passion for Linux and my efforts in making it accessible to everyone, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro.

## About Me

My journey with Linux began when I enrolled at Claim Academy, a cybersecurity boot camp where I got my first taste of Linux through a simple task: installing VirtualBox and Ubuntu. That was the spark that ignited my passion for Linux. From there, I dove deep into learning everything I could, building [admirux.com](https://www.admirux.com) as a way to document my experience and share valuable resources with others. 

I manage ADMIRUX entirely by myself, from writing blog posts to developing tools, and my goal is to grow it into a thriving community for anyone who shares a love for Linux and cybersecurity.

While I’m still learning, I enjoy teaching others along the way. I focus on practical, hands-on projects that help solve real-world problems in Linux environments and contribute to the open-source world.

Currently, I’m preparing for my Security+ and Linux+ certifications, which are key milestones I aim to achieve by the end of the year. Every project and piece of code you’ll find here reflects my journey toward mastering Linux and building a secure, user-friendly environment for others to enjoy.

## My Projects

### 1. **Linux Distro Picker Tool**
This is one of my flagship projects on [admirux.com](https://www.admirux.com). The Linux Distro Picker Tool helps users—whether beginners or experts—find the perfect Linux distribution based on their experience, hardware, and usage needs. It’s designed to look and feel like a terminal interface and provides recommendations tailored to specific requirements. 

The tool takes into account factors like:
- **Experience level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
- **Hardware specifications** (Low-end, Mid-range, High-end, Extreme)
- **Purpose** (Development, Hacking/Networking, Gaming, Servers, Privacy, and more)

Each recommendation is linked directly to the official documentation for easy installation and setup, providing a seamless experience for anyone wanting to try a new Linux distro.

### 2. **ADMIRUX Troubleshooting Wizard**
Troubleshooting can be one of the most daunting aspects of using Linux, especially for newcomers. That’s why I’m developing the ADMIRUX Troubleshooting Wizard. This interactive tool will guide users step-by-step through diagnosing and resolving common Linux issues. It will ask diagnostic questions and, based on the user’s responses, offer tailored solutions with links to relevant resources.

I’m currently working on implementing backend logic using Python and PHP to make the troubleshooting experience smooth and efficient. My goal is to provide a comprehensive troubleshooting solution that saves users time and frustration.

### 3. **Linux Cybersecurity Troubleshooting Portal**
As part of my passion for Linux security, I’m building a portal dedicated to cybersecurity best practices and troubleshooting. This portal will be hosted on [admirux.com](https://www.admirux.com) and will serve as a go-to resource for Linux users seeking solutions to common security problems, including:
- **Security best practices**
- **Incident response plans**
- **Compensating controls**
- **Detective and deterrent controls**

This project aligns with my goal of contributing to a more secure Linux ecosystem and empowering users to protect their systems.

### 4. **Other Projects**
Alongside the major tools, I’m constantly experimenting with new ideas and smaller tools, such as:
- **A Python script that detects when your IP is being pinged.**
- **A Server Configuration Wizard to help users set up secure Linux servers.**
- **A Linux Troubleshooting Portal that provides step-by-step solutions for common issues.**

Stay tuned for more exciting projects as I continue to expand my knowledge and capabilities!

## How You Can Contribute

Your input will help me build better tools and grow ADMIRUX into a more comprehensive resource for Linux users everywhere.

## Future Goals

My vision for the future of ADMIRUX is to continue creating practical tools that help users get the most out of their Linux systems. Some of my goals include:
- Expanding the **Linux Distro Picker Tool** with more options and logic to make it even more precise.
- Building out the **ADMIRUX Troubleshooting Wizard** to cover more use cases and become a go-to solution for Linux troubleshooting.
- Developing a **Linux Cybersecurity Portal** with guides, tools, and tutorials aimed at helping users secure their Linux environments.

Beyond this, I’m excited to build a strong open-source community around ADMIRUX and foster collaboration among Linux enthusiasts.
